Dict√©e Montessori

## TODO

* Maybe add phonems like ch, oi, on
* Horizontally center image
* Play animations on wrong, good and end
* Create a json file with all the word and start with a random word
* Maybe choose letter order and font (lower and upper, cursive or not)
* Sort words regarding their difficulty or specific phonem learning
* Maybe have different sound for the same letter ? But how can we do that for phonems (like eil, ou, oi etc.)
* Have a button that show the solution
